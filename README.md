This application is part of a research project between the University of Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon University.  The goal of the project is to understand the parking behavior of drivers in cities.  Using the app you can record your driving trajectory.  When you start driving simply press the "Start" button and press the "Stop" button when you have parked. The key point is to press the "Park" button the moment you start looking for a parking spot.  Once you have safely parked you can press the "e-mail" button and you can send us this trajectory.  If you want you can cc your e-mail address as well and you can get a copy of your trajectory!  In the e-mail you will be able to provide additional information such as whether you park on-street or off-street, where was your final destination (in order to calculate how far you parked) etc.  Our ultimate goal is to get a better understanding of cruising for parking in cities.  This is the first step for finding viable solutions to the underlying problems!
